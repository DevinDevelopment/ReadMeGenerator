## Description

In this project we will generate a professional read me file. using javascript and the node.js library inquirer. Inquirer will allow us to store questions, display them on to the console one by one and stores the answers.  

Inquirer has two parts. Prompt in which we went over stores the questions and the answers. Next will be the .then will take the responses and push them into a write file method.

within the writefile function. their are two perameters. The name of the file you want to write to and the data.

For the data section we refer to another file called generated markdown witch will take in the response and plug it into the right areas of the generated readme. The reason for this is to keep code orginized by having all the text of the readme in a seperate file. 

In this project we learned about the node library called inquirer and also I have learned about the import keyword called require which will allow us to take modules(functions) from another file by having the other file export its modules(functions) to your main file.
